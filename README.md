# Apostrophe Sandbox

This project powers the [live Apostrophe demo](http://demo.apostrophecms.org). Feel free to study it, but you're better off forking the [apostrophe boilerplate project](https://github.com/punkave/apostrophe-boilerplate) when creating new projects of your own.

In fact, you're best off the [creating your first project](http://apostrophecms.org/docs/tutorials/getting-started/creating-your-first-project.html) tutorial, which covers how to use [apostrophe-cli](https://github.com/punkave/apostrophe-cli) to speed through that process.

This project contains overrides to automatically log the user in and to prevent easy editing of the `admin` account. You don't want these things in a non-demo project.

Deploy easily using Unfurl:
